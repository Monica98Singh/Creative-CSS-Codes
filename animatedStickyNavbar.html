	<h1>What is Chaos</h1>
	<p>Apparently random and unpredictable phenomenon, or the behavior of a complex system, where tiny changes in the starting conditions can lead to very large changes over time. Although in common usage chaos means utter confusion and disorganization, in mathematics it signifies that the equations expressing nonlinear systems are extremely sensitive to initial inputs. And that, while such systems normally show some regularity, it is impossible to predict their future behavior with a high degree of certainty. The term was introduced by the US mathematicians Tien lien Li and James A. Yorke in their 1975 paper 'Period 3 Implies Chaos' which dealt with logistic (differential) functions.<br>The authors, however, did not define 'chaos' and despite its popularity this term (like 'system') remains without a widely-accepted definition. See also chaotic system.<br>
		Most people like to have a sense of order and predictability in their lives; they like to plan for the future and know that there is a reasonable probability of seeing their dreams fulfilled. However, the natural world around us, in spite of its outward beauty and longevity, seems to defy all efforts at predicting its future. Mankind has not yet learned the secrets to predicting the weather more than a few days in advance-and with questionable accuracy at that. <br>Some years ago the multiflora rose, native to Asia, was advocated to farmers as a natural fence for their cattle. It did stop cattle in their tracks, however, it is now illegal to sell multiflora rose in Ohio because it's difficult to stop the multiflora rose-nature has a mind of its own.
     Can we improve our ability to foresee the consequences of our seemingly little actions, or is it hopelessly difficult as Poincaré seemed to imply in 1903.<br>
		Understanding chaos would undoubtedly be of great benefit to mankind. Chaos in itself has been of great benefit, for as Henry Brooks Adams put it: ``Chaos often breeds life, when order breeds habit.'' It may be critically important to understand chaos in order to sustain our own existence as John Fiske eloquently stated in Bounding the United States: ``The United States-bounded on the north by the Aurora Borealis, on the south by the precession, on the east by primeval chaos, and on the west by the Day of Judgement.
